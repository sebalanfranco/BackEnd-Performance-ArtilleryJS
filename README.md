# BackEnd-Performance-ArtilleryJS

Performance testing framework implementation for backend services.

The main goal of this repository is to consolidate knowledge and concepts around performance testing on RESTFul APIs. To achieve this, this POC is based on [Artillery](https://www.artillery.io/), using the [restful-booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html) API as example.
